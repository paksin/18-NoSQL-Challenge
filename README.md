## Description

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. This week's challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The project uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) was also used to format timestamps.

## Models

**User**:

- `username`

  - String
  - Unique
  - Required
  - Trimmed

- `email`

  - String
  - Required
  - Unique
  - Must match a valid email address (look into Mongoose's matching validation)

- `thoughts`

  - Array of `_id` values referencing the `Thought` model

- `friends`
  - Array of `_id` values referencing the `User` model (self-reference)

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `friendCount` that retrieves the length of the user's `friends` array field on query.

---

**Thought**:

- `thoughtText`

  - String
  - Required
  - Must be between 1 and 280 characters

- `createdAt`

  - Date
  - Set default value to the current timestamp
  - Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

- `username` (The user that created this thought)

  - String
  - Required

- `reactions` (These are like replies)
  - Array of nested documents created with the `reactionSchema`

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `reactionCount` that retrieves the length of the thought's `reactions` array field on query.

---

**Reaction** (SCHEMA ONLY)

- `reactionId`

  - Use Mongoose's ObjectId data type
  - Default value is set to a new ObjectId

- `reactionBody`

  - String
  - Required
  - 280 character maximum

- `username`

  - String
  - Required

- `createdAt`
  - Date
  - Set default value to the current timestamp
  - Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

**Schema Settings**:

This will not be a model, but rather will be used as the `reaction` field's subdocument schema in the `Thought` model.
